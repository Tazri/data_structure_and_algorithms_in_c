/**
 * What are Data Structures ?
 * Data structures is a storage that is use to store and organize data.
 * It is way arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and
 * updated efficiently.
 * 
 * Depending on requirment and project, it is important to choose the
 * right data structure for project.
 * 
 * Type of Data structure : 
 * Basically, data structures are divided into two categories :
 * 1. Linear Data structure
 * 2. Non-linear Data structure
 * 
 * Linear Data structures :
 * in linear data structures, the elements are arranged in squence one
 * after the other. Since elements are arranged particular order, they
 * are easy to implement.
 * 
 * However, when the complexity of the program increase, the linear data
 * structues might not be the best choose because of operational complexities.
 * 
 * Example of linear data structures
 * 1. Array
 * 2. Stack
 * 3. Queue
 * 4. Linked List
 * 
 * 
 * Non Linear Data structures : 
 * Unlike linear data structures, elements in not-learner data structures are 
 * not in any sequence. Instead they are arranged in a hierarchical manner
 * where one element will be connected to one or more elements.
 * 
 * Non-linear data structures are further divided into graph and tree based data
 * structures.
 * 
 * 1. Graph Data Structures
 * 2. Trees Data Structures
