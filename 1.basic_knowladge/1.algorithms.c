/**
 * What is Algorithms ?
 * 
 * In computer programming terms, an algorithms is a set of well-defined 
 * instruction to solve a particular problem. It take a set of input and 
 * produces a desired output. 
 * 
 * For example : 
 * An algorithms add two numbers : 
 * 1 --> Take two numbers inputs
 * 2 --> Add numbers using the input + operator
 * 3 --> Display the result
 * 
 * 
 * Qualities of good Algorithms
 * 
 * 1. Input and output defined precisely
 * 2. Each Step in the algorithms should be clear.
 * 3. Algorithms should be effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
 * 4. An algorithms should not include computer code. Instead algorithms should be 
 *    written in such a way that it can be used in different programming language.
